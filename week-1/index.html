        <!--I hid a secret message here because I thought it would be fun. 
            Matching the color of the text to the background was sneaky, huh?
            The hint to uncover this would be to notice I changed the h2 colors, 
            and then to highlight the page (or use Ctr + A) to uncover the secret message. :) -->

            I enjoy archery, soccer, volleyball, singing, magic tricks, reading books, and humor. <br>
            This is my first semester at BYU-Idaho, and I'm enjoying it! <br>
            P.S. Nice job finding my secret message!
